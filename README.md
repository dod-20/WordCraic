## Overview
Briathar is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help learners of the Irish language practice verbs and grammar in an interactive, gamified way. Users can practice common verbs across tenses (past, present, future, and briathar saor) and reinforce key grammar points such as prepositions and possessive adjectives.

The goal is to provide a **lightweight, easy-to-use tool** for students and hobbyists to improve their Irish language skills, with potential for future expansion into premium content.
