# Irish Verb Exercise Design Ideas

The goal of the exercises is to primarily **improve verb conjugation** while also **increasing variety of verbs** a learner is exposed to. Here are several approaches:

---

## 1. Contextual Sentence Fill-in (Improved Version)
- **Traditional:** “____ (she closes) an doras.”
- **Improved:**  
  - Present the **verb in infinitive form** and a **short sentence with a blank**.  
  - Provide **multiple sentence contexts** for the same verb.
- **Example:**  
  - Infinitive: *dún* (to close)  
  - Sentence 1: “____ an doras.” → user fills in “dúnann sí”  
  - Sentence 2: “Ag deireadh an lae, ____ an siopa.” → user fills in “dúnann sé”
- **Benefit:** Same verb, different subject/tense → more variety and reinforcement.

---

## 2. Multiple Choice with Distractors
- Show **infinitive + sentence context** and offer **3–4 options**, including common mistakes.
- **Example:**  
  - Sentence: “____ an doras.” (she)  
  - Options:  
    - a) dúnann sí ✅  
    - b) dúnann sé  
    - c) dúnaimid  
    - d) dúnfaidh sí
- **Benefit:** Encourages recognition and reduces guesswork.

---

## 3. Conjugation Table Drill
- Present a **table with one missing form** and ask the user to fill it in.
- **Example:**

| Person | Singular   | Plural      |
|--------|------------|------------|
| 1st    | dúnaim     | dúnaimid   |
| 2nd    | dúnann tú  | ____       |

- **Benefit:** Direct reinforcement of conjugation patterns.

---

## 4. Verb + Noun Matching
- Match **verbs and common nouns** to form correct sentences.
- **Example:**  
  - Verbs: dún, oscail, léigh  
  - Nouns: an doras, an leabhar, an fuinneog  
  - Correct matches produce:  
    - “dúnann sí an doras”  
    - “léann sé an leabhar”
- **Benefit:** Increases variety of verbs in different contexts.

---

## 5. Mini “Story” Mode
- Present a **2–3 sentence scenario** with multiple blanks for conjugation practice.
- **Example:**  
  - Story: “Máire ____ an doras agus ____ an fuinneog. Ansin sí ____ an leabhar.”  
  - User fills: “dúnann, oscailann, léann”
- **Benefit:** Reinforces conjugation in connected sentences, not isolated blanks.

## Tips for Variety & Engagement
1. Rotate **verb forms and subjects** to avoid repetition.  
2. Include **different tenses** (present, past, future, briathar saor).  
3. Randomize **nouns/objects** with verbs to increase exposure.  
4. Provide **immediate feedback**: show correct form and a short explanation.  
5. Optional: **gamification** with points or streaks to motivate learners.
